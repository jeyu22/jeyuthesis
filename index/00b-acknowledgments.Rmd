I would like to thank the Amherst statistics department for their continuous support during my undergraduate career. I especially want to thank Professor Horton, whose encouragement and constant enthusiasm inspired me to pursue statistics. Additionally, this thesis would not be possible without the guidance of Professor Bailey, who has helped me through this challenging process and allowed me to learn about myself as a researcher.I also want to shout out my SDS partner-in-crime, Kenny Chen. There's no one else I'd rather do group projects with. 
Lastly, I want to thank my family for the sacrifices they've made so I can pursue my passions. They've instilled a love of learning in me that I will have for the rest of my life.
