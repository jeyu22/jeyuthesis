# Conclusion {-}

In this study, we explored how Type I error rates from 4 different DF methods: Kenward-Roger, Satterthwaite, standard DF method, and $t$-as-$z$ compare when evaluating significance of fixed effects of linear mixed models, particularly in small samples and in nonnormal distributions. Using a range of sample sizes, number of measurements, lognormal, and exponential distributions, as well as both random intercept and random slope models, we found distinct differences in performance of DF methods. DF methods applied to random slope models produced more anti-conservative Type I error rates in comparison to random intercept models. While increasing the number of measurements appears to increase robustness of most methods, the same effect for sample size was not identified. Across the 4 DF methods, KR and Satterthwaite DF were consistently more robust and less anti-conservative; while both are preferable, they occasionally differ in performance in random slope models in which KR is too conservative. When fitting linear mixed models to a subset of a children's longitudinal health survey, we find that the significance of fixed effects differs between KR and Satterthwaite DF. Our results indicate that performance of DF methods can vary greatly in small sample sizes, which can in turn impact the conclusions drawn about the fixed effects. Further exploration into other nonnormal distributions and other criteria that could impact DF method is needed.
