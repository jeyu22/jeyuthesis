Linear mixed-effects models are widely used in social and biological sciences, and are also used for longitudinal data analysis. In cases where sample sizes are small, evaluating the significance of fixed effects becomes challenging, and Type I error rates across different degrees-of-freedom (DF) methods vary. While previous studies have shown that Kenward-Roger and Satterthwaite DF produce robust Type I error rates for smaller samples, the performance of these methods on small nonnormal distributions has not been explored. Through simulation, we show that model complexity, sample size, and number of measurements play a role in the performance of 4 DF methods across distributions of varying skewness and kurtosis. Additionally, we find that Kenward-Roger and Satterthwaite DF methods produce favorable Type I error rates in comparison to DF methods designed for larger sample sizes.
